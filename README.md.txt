# SNAKE APPLICATION/GAME USING C, SDL & TTF
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
SNAKE GAME MADE USING C, SDL & TTF, SDL WAS USED FOR GRAPHICS, TTF WAS FOR FONTS
AND CODED THE EVERYTHING ELSE IN C. USED YOUTUBE TO FIND OUT HOW TO CREATE A GAME LOOP
THEN DESIGNED A MAIN MENU, A SINGLE PLAYER MODE, EXIT BUTTON AND ENDGAME SCREEN.
ORIGINALLY WANTED TO CREATE A 2 PLAYER MODE BUT REALLY WANTED TO FINISH BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR
SO BY SELECTING 2 PLAYER MODE IT SIMPLY EXITS THE APPLICATION. :( OTHERWISE I AM PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT FINISHING
THE APPLICATION. HANDLING MEMORY WAS ANNOYING BUT IN THE END I FINISHED IT.
